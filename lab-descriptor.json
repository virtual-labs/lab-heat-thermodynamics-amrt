    "introduction": "The Heat and Thermodynamics Virtual Laboratory is designed to provide an interactive, simulation-based learning environment that reinforces fundamental principles of heat transfer and thermodynamic processes. This virtual lab focuses on the core mechanisms of heat transfer—conduction, convection, and radiation—as well as key thermodynamic phenomena such as phase transitions, thermal radiation behavior, and thermoelectric effects. Through virtual experiments, students can explore theoretical laws, observe physical behaviors, and perform quantitative analysis without the constraints of physical equipment or laboratory scheduling.",
